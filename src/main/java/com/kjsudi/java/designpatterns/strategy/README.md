#Strategy Design Pattern


Strategy pattern lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.

For the example provided here, a client's requirement is to be able to search for something on the Internet.
A default search Engine is used at first, which is configurable.
Each search Engine would have its own behavior on how to perform the search and what results to be shown.

If the user at any time feels that the default search engine is to be changed, then he or she can change that behavior.
